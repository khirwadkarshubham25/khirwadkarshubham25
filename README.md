# üí´ Hello World!


![visitor badge](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=khirwadkarshubham25.khirwadkarshubham25)

I am a highly focused Software Engineer specializing in the design, development, and deployment of scalable, high-performance backend systems. My foundation lies in utilizing Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate) and Python to build robust RESTful APIs that power critical business processes.

My technical vision is rooted in strong academics, holding a Master's degree in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Arlington and a Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology. This formal education is complemented by practical, cutting-edge knowledge, including recent certifications like the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. I am adept at translating complex theoretical concepts into well-engineered, secure, and production-ready applications.

I am driven by product impact and ownership. My experience centers on translating complex business requirements into elegant, efficient code that directly enhances the user experience. I have consistently taken ownership of key modules, from initial architectural planning to final deployment, ensuring maximum reliability and minimal latency.

I am passionate about blending strong backend engineering with proactive cybersecurity. My focus is building systems that are not only fast and reliable, but are designed to be secure right from the start. I am actively leveraging my deep software development skills to pivot toward roles centered on security operations and building secure, resilient applications.

I thrive in Agile environments, serving as a proactive contributor who reinforces best practices in code quality, system stability, and continuous integration. I am committed to deep technical collaboration and mentorship within my team, elevating the overall engineering standard.
